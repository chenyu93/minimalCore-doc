Welcome to minimalCore documentation!
===================================

**minimalCore**  
is an experimental testbed for game AI, e.g., NPCs, Bots and AIGC, built on Unreal Engine (also, an experimental Unity release is comming soon). 
It is open-source, cross platform, developed as an Unreal plugin 
that can simply be dropped into any Unreal environment. 

The plugin provides perceptual modules 
(visual-based and engine-API-based) and decision-making modules, 
and more than 100 preset NPCs with different appearances, actions and personality.
After a small amount of settings, 
the NPCs can interact in any given environment.


Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
